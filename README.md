# Modular-Programming-Assignment
This was my first year modular programmig assignment in python. It is much less complex than other projects listed, as it was an introduction to modular procedural programming and file r/w . 
It was also a continuation of an introduction to programming in general, and understanding python syntax, data types, library and module imports. It is a simple text based console UI for
recording attendance records in plaintext files, requiring authorized acces via usernames and passwords with error handling.
